Mobile app for preferences-based suggestions on movies, music, books, tv series and videogames.

This app is an exam project, so it has to be finished and has a local database to complete it in a short time.

An user can signin or login if already registered.
Once gained the access he can search between the 5 categories something similar to his tastes.
The app gives all the results similar in genre. 
The user can add them to preferencies to remember it later, or share his new discovery on pretty all sharing channells ( facebook, tweeter, whatsapp, sms, email...).
Also he can access to his account (in the side menu) to consult and edit his own preferencies.

App developed with Apache Cordova, based on Backbone.js, RequireJS and Handlebars. Works on Android.

Project in the "tt" folder.
